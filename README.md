- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rolfmeles â€“ a German sf/fantasy author, biologist and artist.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in fictional languages, biology, usage of the dozenal system, computer fonts and worldbuilding.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create believable languages for my novel projects. I am happily using #polyglot by @DraqueT for it.
